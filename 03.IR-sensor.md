# How to Interface with IR sensor.
IR sensor has 3 legs/leads:
  - VCC
  - GND
  - Power
VCC leg needs connected to 5v in the ardiono, GND leg needs connect GND port in the GND port in the ardino
Power leg can be connected to any leg.

Note:- Here we are trying to interface a sensor(IR-sensor) to the arduino board, if its find any obstracle a LED is connect in the bread board.
LED is connected to the port digital port 8 as OUTPUT and IR sensor is connected to the digital port 7 as the INPUT mode.
Here is the code

```cpp
int ir=7;
int led2=8;
int x;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(7,INPUT);
pinMode(8,OUTPUT);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
x=digitalRead(7);
Serial.println(x);
if (x==1)
    {
    digitalWrite(8,LOW);
    }
else
    {
    digitalWrite(8,HIGH);
    }
}
```

Notes:
The ```digitalRead(buttonPin)``` function reads the sensors from the digital port 7
- 1 indicates there is no obstrucle 
- 0 indicates there is obstrucle.
